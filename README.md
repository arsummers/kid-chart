# kid-chart
This is going to be the web-app version of kid chart.
Current goal is to make this into a usuable django site, then make a django rest framework version to feed into a mobile-app friendly front-end.

Don't forget about Docker

will need to use
`poetry export -f requirements.txt -o requirements.txt`
since I'm using poetry instead of pip
don't forget to test this too

### Architecture

#### Models:

- User
    - name - this is intended to be for the parent or whoever is in charge of taking care and setting rules
    - will need to be able to fill out data-base/API from UI, and have it be unique for each user.

- Kid
    - name
    - points counter

- Rule
    - will need a "weight" value
    - name
    - description
